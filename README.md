# resume
Copyright (c) 2019 Liam Wynn

The purpose for this is to basically take the great workflow that
I normally use for programming (git + Makefiles + tmux) and apply it
to my resume. Also, this is great for potential recruiters or companies that
have found my resume or some copy of it.

# Viewing my resume
If you open the `resume/` directory, you will likely see several subfolders.
For example, you may see `master/`, `web-dev/`, `object-oriented/` and so on.
The idea is that `resume/master/resume.pdf` is the "master" version of my resume.
That is, I keep a version that has ALL of my skills and ALL my experience and ALL my
projects and so on. Obviously this will blow up into a gargangtuan tome as I grow
in my skills.

The one that would be sent out would be say `resume/web-dev/resume.pdf`. This one
would be tailored to a web dev gig if that's what I'm applying for.
